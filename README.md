# Store on Express/React/Node.js

 - JSON file as database!

## About the project:

Frontend:

 - Reusing the same component for modal windows.
 - My implementation of the shopping cart (frontend).
 - Everything is based on functional components.
 - Lightbox images.

Used the following approaches:

 - Dynamic import using asynchronous functions 
 (allows you to defer rendering of elements while the page is loading) - 
 `Fullstack.js` file. 

Functionality of the admin panel and interaction with the client side:
 - Adding/removing a product (name, price, description, photo)
 - Currency change

Next task:
 - `TODO` - add editing for each user;
 - `TODO` - add data entry validation
 - `TODO` - confirmation when deleting a user
 - `TODO` - implement authorization

Work on the project continues.
